He tried the edge of his {7} on the trunk of the tree and barked it so that it died.\nSome time after this, his father discovered what had happened to his favorite tree. He came into the house in great anger, and demanded to know who the mischievous person was who had {8} away the bark. Nobody could tell him anything about it.\nJust then {0}, with his little hatchet, came into the room.\n\"{0}\", said his father, \"do you know who has killed my beautiful little cherry tree yonder in the {4}? I would not have taken {9} {10} for it!\"\nThis was a {11} question to answer, and for a moment {0} was staggered by it, but {12} recovering himself he cried:\n\"I cannot tell a lie, father, you know I cannot tell a lie!

Yes - though they were blossomed with {14} and had {15} of the purest {16}!\"",
